# Prometheus alerting rules for Stage0 Runbook API
#
# Usage:
#   1. Place this file in your Prometheus rules directory (e.g., /etc/prometheus/rules/)
#   2. Reference it in prometheus.yml:
#      rule_files:

#   3. Reload Prometheus: promtool check rules prometheus-alerts.yml && killall -HUP prometheus
#
# Adjust thresholds based on your SLOs and requirements
